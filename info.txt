Some emaik thread with the guy from SignalsmithStretch, I needed help upgrading from an older to a newer version. 
I haven't applied his suggestion yet:

Hi Geraint

in my code I also passed a config, because I was playing a bit with quality vs delaytime:

 stretchNode.setState({
        pitch: {semitones: transpose},
        // Defaults I think is 120 / 30
        // With blockMs below 70, and intervalMs at 30 you start to hear the cracks
        // But because we have audio sync fixed (see inject.js), this is not an issue
        //config: {blockMs: 30, intervalMs: 10}
        config: {blockMs: blockMs, intervalMs: intervalMs}
    });

I'm not seeing this blockMs and intervalMs config on the new documentation page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/signalsmith-stretch

I don't need this per se, but I just wanted to check if the defaults for this newer version are still 120 and 30ms? I use other code to offset the video timings to. synchronize playback with the chords.

==================

Hi Tijmen,

Yep, those are still the defaults.  You can specify them with stretchNode.configure({...config...}), which I should also add to the docs!

However, I just did a JS build on the chunked-computation branch.  If you use the JS releases from there, then as well as a new .latency() method (returning a Promise, resolving to latency in seconds), there's an optional "chunkedComputation" boolean flag in the config object.

This spreads the computation out more evenly over time (which should be better for low-power devices), but adds one additional interval of latency.  So, if you call stretchNode.configure({splitComputation: true}), then stretchNode.latency() should return 0.15.
